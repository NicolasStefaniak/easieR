Description: easieR aims to provide a flexible graphic user interface (GUI), allowing the use of either command lines or 
    GUI on each specific function. This flexibility is helpful to rapidly be able to obtain complete results without 
    mastering a lot of individual functions. Output is standardized so that user has not to adapt to each programmer 
    preference. easieR performs most classical analyses (e.g., descriptive, t test, chi squared, correlations, analysis of 
    variance and covariance, factor analysis, regressions, logistic regressions, reliability analyses...). 
    It will also allow to obtain pedagogical demonstration based on TeachingDemos package, graphics based on ggplot2, 
    and manipulation data. easieR is an R metapackage allowing to find in one location all (or at least a part of) the 
    best of R. The functions are compiled in order to provide a structured output. For all the analyses, assumptions are 
    checked, user can choose between parametric, non parametric and robust statistics (based on WRS and WRS2 packages). 
    It also allows user to easily identify and remove outliers from the analyses and to save results in nice output.
